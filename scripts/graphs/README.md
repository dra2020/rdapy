# How to Generate Contiguity Graphs

TODO -- Need to make this work w/o relying on the extracted data used in scoring.

Sequence:

* Extract graph -> /tmp/locations
* Check
* Fix




```bash
scripts/graphs/EXTRACT-GRAPHS.sh
```

```bash
scripts/graphs/CHECK-GRAPHS.sh
```

Update this to graph precinct locations into a temporary JSON file.

```bash
scripts/graphs/FIX-GRAPHS.sh
```
