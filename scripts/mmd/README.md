# Multi-Member District (MMD) Scoring

The scripts in this directory and the support code they use in the `rdapy` package are part of an experiment to
figure out how to score multi-member districting plans with respect to the opportunity for minority representation. 
This is a work in progress.

Note: "MMD" here refers to multi-member districts, not to be confused with majority-minority districts.
