Redistricting analytics (Python)

The analytics here are the main ones used in [Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org/maps#).
Unlike the analytics in [dra-analytics](https://github.com/dra2020/dra-analytics) which are implememented
in TypeScript, these are implemented in Python and do not depend on the DRA codebase or implement any
DRA-specific functionality.
